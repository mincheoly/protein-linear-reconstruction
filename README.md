# protein-linear-reconstruction
Final project for EE 368 (Digital Image Processing) by Christian Choe and Min Cheol Kim.

Linear reconstruction of several shuffled videos with nonlinear dimensionality reduction and minimum spanning trees.

This project was continued to generalize reconstruction to an arbitrary transitions.
